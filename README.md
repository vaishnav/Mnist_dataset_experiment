# Mnist_dataset_experiment

## Intro
The MNIST database is the collection of handwritten dataset which has a training set of 60,000 examples, and a test set of 10,000 examples. It is a subset of a larger set available from NIST. The digits have been size-normalized and centered in a fixed-size image. 

## Usage
1. Enter the dataset path in the datapath varible in the code to read from the dataset you've downloded
2. Later you can use pickle file for dataset so you have to read original dataset once only


## Dependencies 
1. Matplotlib
2. Numpy
3. Scikit learn
